_**Abstract**_ **—A long-term accurate and robust localization system**
**is essential for mobile robots to operate efficiently outdoors. Re-**
**cent studies have shown the significant advantages of the wheel-**
**mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead**
**reckoning system. However, it still drifts over extended periods**
**because of the absence of external correction signals. To achieve**
**the goal of long-term accurate localization, we propose Wheel-**
**GINS, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/inertial**
**navigation system (INS) integrated navigation system using a**
**Wheel-IMU. Wheel-GINS fuses the GNSS position measurement**
**with the Wheel-IMU via an extended Kalman filter to limit the**
**long-term error drift and provide continuous state estimation**
**when the GNSS signal is blocked. Considering the specificities of**
**the GNSS/Wheel-IMU integration, we conduct detailed modeling**
**and online estimation of the Wheel-IMU installation parameters,**
**including the Wheel-IMU leverarm and mounting angle and the**
**wheel radius error. Experimental results have shown that Wheel-**
**GINS outperforms the traditional GNSS/Odometer/INS inte-**
**grated navigation system during GNSS outages. At the same time,**
**Wheel-GINS can effectively estimate the Wheel-IMU installation**
**parameters online and, consequently, improve the localization**
**accuracy and practicality of the system. The source code of our**
**implementation is publicly available (https://github.com/i2Nav-**

I. I NTRODUCTION
# L OCALIZATION is the foundation for many other tasksin mobile robots, such as environment perception [1]–

[4] and path planning [5]. An accurate and robust localization system operating over a long period is crucial for the
robots to function effectively without human supervision and
intervention. To this end, modern robots are always equipped
with multiple sensors, e.g., LiDAR, camera, odometer, inertial
measurement unit (IMU), Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) receiver, etc., to take their complementary advantages via sensor fusion for state estimation. Among all these
sensors, inertial sensors play an essential role because they
are self-contained. In other words, they measure the robot’s
egomotion independently without other external signals and

interaction with the environment. In addition, inertial sensors
are cheap and consume lightweight computational resources.
Therefore, investigating the inertial navigation system (INS)
offers significant potential for enhancing the performance of
sensor fusion-based navigation systems.

In two recent papers [6], [7], the authors proposed WheelINS, a 2D dead reckoning system using only one wheelmounted IMU (Wheel-IMU). To be specific, they multiply the
gyroscope readings of the Wheel-IMU with the wheel radius
to compute the wheel velocity, which is then combined with
the non-holonomic constraints to integrate with the strapdown
INS [8], [9] via an extended Kalman filter (EKF). WheelINS offers two key advantages. First, it uses the Wheel-IMU
gyroscope measurement to calculate wheel speed, achieving
similar information fusion as the traditional odometer-aided

INS with only one sensor. Second, the continuous rotation
of the wheel helps mitigate the constant IMU bias errors.
Experimental results [6] show that Wheel-INS outperforms the
traditional odometer-aided INS in terms of pose accuracy. In
addition, it exhibits significant resilience to constant IMU bias
error compared to the traditional odometer-aided INS.

While Wheel-INS demonstrates effective dead reckoning
performance, it is a relative positioning system that cannot
constrain long-term error drift. To address this limitation,
Wu et al. proposed Wheel-SLAM [10], which used the road
bank angle, indicated by the vehicle roll angle estimation

from Wheel-INS, to construct a terrain map. This enables
loop closure detection and pose correction to limit the error
accumulation. However, Wheel-SLAM is only applicable for
those applications where the robot moves in constrained environments while failing in scenarios where the robot does not
have the opportunity to revisit the places it has been before, for
example, a self-driving car driving from one city to another.
Therefore, external correction signals are necessary to limit
the long-term error drift of Wheel-INS.
Because of the complementary advantages of GNSS and
INS, the GNSS/INS integrated navigation system has been
widely applied to real-world robot navigation applications.
On the one hand, GNSS [11] can provide accurate absolute
positions to correct the error drift of INS. On the other hand,
INS can provide continuous state estimation when GNSS is
not available. Then, a natural question arises: _How to integrate_
_GNSS with Wheel-INS to achieve the goal of a long-term_
_accurate and robust navigation system?_
The main contribution of this paper is the development of an
algorithm to fuse GNSS with Wheel-INS, along with a study
of its characteristics and an evaluation of its performance.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first GNSS/INS
integrated navigation system in the literature that uses a wheelmounted IMU. Specifically, we integrate the GNSS position
measurement into the EKF pipeline building on top of WheelINS; thus, Wheel-GINS can achieve a similar information

fusion scheme as the conventional GNSS/Odometer/INS in
tegrated navigation system (ODO-GINS). However, WheelGINS is more promising than ODO-GINS due to the advantages of Wheel-INS. Fig. 1 shows the vehicle trajectories estimated by the proposed Wheel-GINS and ODO-GINS
compared to ground truth in our car experiment. We can see
that the error drift of Wheel-GINS is significantly smaller
compared to ODO-GINS during GNSS outages.
In addition, the misalignment between the GNSS and the
Wheel-IMU is different from that between the GNSS and

the normal IMU, which is usually placed on the top or in
the body of the robot. To handle this issue and improve
the practicality of the proposed Wheel-GINS, we perform
detailed modeling of the Wheel-IMU installation parameters,
including the Wheel-IMU leverarm (position misalignment)
and mounting angle (attitude misalignment), and the wheel



radius scale error to estimate them online. Furthermore, we
propose a wheel angular velocity constraint model to accelerate the convergence of the Wheel-IMU mounting angle online
estimation. Details of the Wheel-IMU installation parameters
are presented in Section III-A. Fig. 2 overviews the algorithm
structure of the proposed Wheel-GINS.
In sum, we make two key claims: (i) Wheel-GINS has significantly reduced the position error drift compared to ODOGINS during GNSS outages; (ii) Wheel-GINS can effectively
estimate the Wheel-IMU installation parameters, including
the Wheel-IMU leverarm and mounting angle and the wheel
radius scale error online, thus improving the pose estimation
accuracy. Our experimental evaluation backs up these claims.


II. R ELATED W ORK


_A. State Estimation using Wheel-mounted IMUs_


Researchers have proposed various low-cost alternatives to
wheel odometers for measuring wheel velocity using wheelmounted IMUs [12]–[14]. Youssef et al. [12] proposed detecting peaks and valleys in the accelerometer signal to count complete wheel cycles and compute the traveled distance of the
robot. Coulter et al. [14] used the Wheel-IMU accelerometer
to measure the wheel’s rotation angle and movement duration.
Gersdorf et al. [13] employed a gyroscope on the wheel’s
rotation axis and two accelerometers on the wheel plane to
measure vehicle acceleration and estimate wheel velocity via
EKF. However, these studies focus solely on vehicle velocity
information, not vehicle pose.
Collin et al. [15], [16] proposed the first 2D localization
system based only on a Wheel-IMU. It used the two accelerometers on the wheel plane to estimate the wheel rotation
angle and, thus, the traveled distance. Meanwhile, it used
the gyroscope measurements to calculate the vehicle heading.
However, this method assumed a constant vehicle speed, and
the misalignment error was not considered. Recently, Tan [17]
proposed to use the tri-axis accelerometer output and the
gyroscope output at the rotation axis of the Wheel-IMU as
the observation model to fuse with the kinematic model of

the wheel angular velocity and acceleration via EKF.
Niu et al. [6] proposed an EKF-based approach to estimate
the 2D robot state using only a Wheel-IMU. They obtained the
wheel velocity by multiplying the gyroscope readings on the
wheel rotation axis with the wheel radius instead of relying
on an odometer or wheel encoder. This velocity was then
fused with the non-holonomic constraint to integrate with
the strapdown INS via an EKF, achieving a methodology
akin to traditional odometer-aided INS approaches [18]. Based
on Wheel-INS, the authors further compared three different
observation models obtained from the Wheel-IMU [7] and
extended single Wheel-IMU to multiple IMUs mounted on
different places of the vehicle for better state estimation
performance [19]. To limit the error drift of Wheel-INS, they
proposed Wheel-SLAM [10], using the vehicle roll angle
estimated by Wheel-INS to build a terrain map for loop closure
detection and pose correction.
However, current studies have only investigated the dead
reckoning system using Wheel-IMU. The feasibility, system

characteristics, and performance of fusing the Wheel-IMU
with global positioning sensors, such as GNSS, have not been
studied so far.


_B. GNSS/INS Fusion_



Although GNSS/Wheel-IMU fusion has not been investigated, the GNSS/INS integrated navigation system, using
a normal IMU mounted on the body of the vehicle, has
been extensively studied in the past decades [ **?** ], [20]–[23].
Nowadays, it has become a standard component of many
vehicle navigation systems. GNSS/INS integration framework
can be divided into loosely coupled and tightly coupled,
depending on which measurement from GNSS is used. In
the loosely coupled system [9], [24], [25], the position (and
velocity) estimated by the GNSS receiver is fused with INS,
while the tightly coupled system [26]–[28] directly integrates
raw GNSS measurements, such as pseudorange and carrier
phase measurements. Although various methods, such as factor
graphs [29]–[31], have been proposed to fuse GNSS with INS,
the most common one is still the EKF [9], [21]. Because
this study focuses on investigating the idea and feasibility of
fusing GNSS with Wheel-IMU instead of algorithm research
for GNSS/INS fusion, we adopt the classical loosely coupled
framework and use the EKF in the proposed Wheel-GINS.
To improve the accuracy of GNSS/INS integrated navigation system during GNSS outages, various sensors, such
as cameras [32]–[34], LiDARs [35]–[37], and odometers [9],

[38], [39] have been introduced into the GNSS/INS integrated
system. Unlike cameras and LiDARs, which depend on environmental conditions, odometers are preferable due to their
independence from the environment [18], [40]. The vehicle
velocity provided by the odometer is always combined with the
non-holonomic constraints [41] as a 3D velocity measurement
to fuse with INS. It has been illustrated that the odometer

and non-holonomic constraints significantly enhance the pose
accuracy when GNSS is not available [42], [43]. Because the
proposed Wheel-GINS achieves a similar information fusion
as the traditional GNSS/Odometer/INS integrated navigation
system, we use it as a benchmark to illustrate the performance
of Wheel-GINS in the experiments.


III. P REREQUISITES


_A. Sensors Setup_


In Wheel-GINS, only two sensors, a GNSS module and
a wheel-mounted IMU are used. The IMU is mounted on

the vehicle’s non-steering wheel, while the GNSS antenna
is placed on the top of the vehicle. Our Wheel-IMU design
uses an in-built battery for power supply and a Bluetooth
module for data transmission. Table I lists the definitions of
the relevant coordinate systems. Fig. 3 provides a detailed
depiction of the vehicle and IMU coordinate systems.
Given a stable vehicle structure, the difference between the
wheel heading and vehicle heading should remain constant,
according to the definitions of the _vehicle_ -frame and _wheel_ frame, namely,
_ψ_ _w_ = _ψ_ _v_ + _π/_ 2 _,_ (1)



Fig. 3. Illustration of the _vehicle_ -frame, _wheel_ -frame, and IMU _body_ frame [6]. More details can be found in Table I. _**l**_ _w_ indicates the leverarm
between the Wheel-IMU and the wheel center; the non-parallelism of the
_wheel_ -frame and _body_ -frame indicates the mounting angle between the WheelIMU and the wheel. Note that the origin of the _vehicle_ -frame is defined at
the wheel center (see Table I). Here, we plot it on the vehicle body only for
easy visualization.


where _ψ_ _w_ and _ψ_ _v_ denote the wheel heading and vehicle heading, respectively. If the Wheel-IMU were perfectly aligned
with the wheel, its heading would equal the wheel heading,
and consequently, we could directly determine the vehicle’s
heading from the Wheel-IMU state. However, misalignment is
inevitable in practical systems that integrate information from
multiple sensors. As shown in Fig. 3, the misalignment errors
of Wheel-IMU include position misalignment and attitude
misalignment. In Wheel-INS [6], the authors illustrated the
negative impact of misalignment errors on the system performance. However, in Wheel-INS, the Wheel-IMU misalignment
errors are calibrated offline, which causes inconvenience for
practical use. In Wheel-GINS, we incorporate the attitude and
position misalignment errors between the Wheel-IMU and the
wheel, along with errors in wheel radius, into the state vector.
These parameters are estimated online to enhance the system’s
practicality.
The position misalignment is also termed as leverarm ( _**l**_ _w_ ),
indicating the vector pointing from the Wheel-IMU center to
the wheel center expressed in the _body_ -frame. We take only
the components in the _y_ -axis and _z_ -axis into consideration. The
reason is threefold. First, the leverarm error on the wheel plane
is more important. Second, the leverarm error in the direction
of the rotation axis is trivial if the attitude misalignment
is compensated. Third, reducing one dimension in the state
vector can save some computation resources. Therefore, we
have
_⊤_
_**l**_ _w_ = � _l_ _y_ _l_ _z_ � _._ (2)


The attitude misalignment is also termed as mounting angle
( _**ϕ**_ _m_ ), which can be represented by a set of Euler angles _φ_ _m_
(roll mounting angle), _θ_ _m_ (pitch mounting angle), and _ψ_ _m_
(heading mounting angle). With this, the _wheel_ -frame can be
rotated by _ψ_ _m_, _θ_ _m_, and _φ_ _m_ around the _z_ -axis, _y_ -axis, and _x_ axis respectively to align with the _body_ -frame. Because the
wheel continuously rotates with the _x_ -axis, the roll mounting

angle and the heading mounting angle, namely,


_⊤_
_**ϕ**_ _m_ = � _θ_ _m_ _ψ_ _m_ � _._ (3)


Note that we consider the 3D vector of both the leverarm

and mounting angle when we derive the observation model
equations to simplify the expression. In practice, we extract
the components from the equations corresponding to the
actual misalignment error to construct the matrix for the final
computation in the EKF (see Section IV-B).
In addition, the measured wheel radius may also have
an error because the vehicle weight, temperature, and tire
pressure would all cause wheel deformation. It is necessary
to compensate for this error because it plays an important role
in computing the wheel velocity in Wheel-GINS. Here, we
model the wheel radius error as a scale factor error, namely,


_r_ ˆ = (1 + _s_ _r_ ) _r,_ (4)


where ˆ _r_ is the measured wheel radius; _s_ _r_ is the wheel
radius scale error, augmented into the state vector for online
estimation; _r_ is the true wheel radius, which is unknown. More

details of the online estimation of the Wheel-IMU installation

parameters are presented in Section IV.



_B. Wheel-INS_


Wheel-GINS, proposed in this paper, builds on top of our
prior work Wheel-INS [6], a 2D dead reckoning system using
only one wheel-mounted IMU. To be specific, we perform
the strapdown INS to predict the vehicle state in WheelINS. At the same time, we multiply the gyroscope readings
in the _x_ -axis of the Wheel-IMU with the wheel radius to

calculate the vehicle forward velocity. After that, this velocity
is integrated with the non-holonomic constraints as a full 3D
velocity observation to correct the INS-indicated robot state
via an EKF. We use the error-state formulation to mitigate
the nonlinearity issue, which includes the vehicle position,
velocity, and attitude errors, as well as the bias and scale factor
error of the IMU sensor. We calibrate the Wheel-IMU leverarm

and mounting angle offline in Wheel-INS.
Because the Wheel-IMU rotates with the wheel, Wheel-INS
cannot accurately estimate the vehicle pitch angle. In other
words, it cannot determine whether the vehicle is ascending
or descending. Consequently, Wheel-INS assumes the vehicle
moves on a horizontal plane, limiting its localization capabilities to two dimensions.


IV. O UR A PPROACH


Wheel-GINS is built on top of Wheel-INS. In Wheel-GINS,
we fuse the absolute position information from GNSS with
Wheel-INS using an EKF. As in the case of Wheel-INS,
we use the error state as the system model to mitigate the
nonlinearity issue. In addition to the vehicle velocity observation used in Wheel-INS, we construct the GNSS position
observation model to limit the long-term error drift and the
wheel angular velocity constraint model for online mounting
angle estimation in Wheel-GINS. In this section, we elaborate
on the error state model and the observation models used in

Wheel-GINS.


_A. Error State Model_


In Wheel-INS, we simplify the INS propagation model by
omitting less significant terms, e.g., earth rotation, as it is only
a local dead reckoning system using a low-cost inertial sensor.
This simplification reduces computational overhead without
compromising accuracy. In contrast, Wheel-GINS employs a
full strapdown INS in the _earth_ -frame to integrate precise
global position data from GNSS. For detailed information on
the strapdown INS model, refer to [8], [9].
We adopt an error-state model in EKF to mitigate nonlinear
errors in Wheel-GINS. In addition to the vehicle state and the

IMU sensor errors, we augment the Wheel-IMU installation
parameter errors (including the Wheel-IMU leverarm and
mounting angle and the wheel radius scale error) into the error
state vector, which can be written as


_⊤_
_**x**_ = � _δ_ _**p**_ _[⊤]_ _δ_ _**v**_ _[⊤]_ _**ϕ**_ _[⊤]_ _**b**_ _[⊤]_ _g_ _**b**_ _[⊤]_ _a_ _**s**_ _[⊤]_ _g_ _**s**_ _[⊤]_ _a_ _δ_ _**l**_ _w_ _[⊤]_ _[δ]_ _**[ϕ]**_ _[⊤]_ _m_ _[s]_ _[r]_ � _,_
(5)
where _δ_ indicates the error of the vehicle state, particularly,
_δ_ _**p**_, _δ_ _**v**_ and _**ϕ**_ _∈_ so(3) indicate the position, velocity, and
attitude errors of INS in the _n_ -frame, respectively; _**b**_ _g_ and _**b**_ _a_
represent the residual bias errors of the gyroscope and the

accelerometer, respectively; _**s**_ _g_ and _**s**_ _a_ represent the residual
scale factor errors of the gyroscope and accelerometer, respectively; _δ_ _**l**_ _w_ _∈_ R [2] is the residual Wheel-IMU leverarm error;
_δ_ _**ϕ**_ _m_ _∈_ R [2] is the residual Wheel-IMU mounting angle error;
_s_ _r_ _∈_ R is the scale error of the wheel radius. Therefore, _**x**_ is a

vector with 26 dimensions. The IMU sensor errors are modeled

using the first-order Gauss-Markov process, while the WheelIMU leverarm error, mounting angle error, and wheel radius
scale error are modeled using random walks.
We use the detailed error-state model [9], [44] in WheelGINS instead of the simplified version used in Wheel-INS.
Because Wheel-GINS aims to provide accurate positioning
results in large-scale (kilometer-level) environments, instead of
medium-scale (hundred-meters level) environments for WheelINS, we have to take more terms into consideration, for
example, the earth rotation, the rotation rate of the _n_ -frame
with respect to the _earth_ -frame and the change of gravity. The
error state model is given by

observation used in the EKF scheme of the proposed WheelGINS. Different from Wheel-INS, we incorporate the WheelIMU installation parameters into the state vector for online
estimation. Note that the Wheel-IMU leverarm and mounting
angle errors are modeled as 2D vectors, while the wheel radius
scale error is modeled as a scalar (see Section III-A). Although
our derivation considers the full 3D vector of the Wheel-IMU

leverarm and mounting angle, we extract only the elements
relevant to the state vector for matrix construction in practical
computation.

_1) Vehicle Velocity Observation:_ To compute the wheel
velocity, we first need to know the rotation speed of the wheel.
Therefore, we need to transform the Wheel-IMU angular
velocity from the _body_ -frame to the _wheel_ -frame, namely,


ˆ
_**ω**_ _[w]_ = **R** [ˆ] _[w]_ _b_ _**[ω]**_ [ˆ] _[,]_ (7)


where ˆ _**ω**_ _[w]_ is the estimated angular velocity of the wheel in the
_wheel_ -frame; **R** [ˆ] _[w]_ _b_ [is the rotation matrix from the] _[ body]_ [-frame]
to the _wheel_ -frame; _**ω**_ is the angular velocity measurement
of the Wheel-IMU in the _body_ -frame. Because we only need
the wheel angular velocity in the _x_ -axis of the _wheel_ -frame to
calculate the wheel velocity, we can simplify the equation as


_ω_ ˆ _x_ _[w]_ [= ˆ] **[R]** _[w]_ _b_ (1 _,_ :) _**[ω]**_ [ˆ] _[,]_ (8)


where ˆ _ω_ _x_ _[w]_ [is the estimated angular velocity of the wheel in]
the _x_ -axis of the _wheel_ -frame; **R** [ˆ] _[w]_ _b_ (1 _,_ :) [is the first row of the]
rotation matrix from the **R** ˆ _[w]_ _body_ -frame to the _wheel_ -frame, where
_b_ (1 _,_ :) [=] **[ R]** _[w]_ _b_ (1 _,_ :) [+] _[δ]_ **[R]** _b_ _[w]_ (1 _,_ :) [, and] _[ δ]_ **[R]** _b_ _[w]_ (1 _,_ :) [is the error of the first]
row of the rotation matrix, which is governed by the WheelIMU mounting angle error _δ_ _**ϕ**_ _m_ .
Further, taking into consideration the wheel radius scale
error, we can calculate the forward wheel velocity and derive
the error as


_v_ � _wheel_ _[v]_ [= ˆ] _[ω]_ _x_ _[w]_ _[r]_ [ˆ] _[ −]_ _[e]_ _[v]_ [= ˆ] **[R]** _[w]_ _b_ (1 _,_ :) _**[ω]**_ [ˆ] _[r]_ [ˆ] _[ −]_ _[e]_ _[v]_
= ( **R** _[w]_ _b_ (1 _,_ :) [+] _[ δ]_ **[R]** _[w]_ _b_ (1 _,_ :) [)(] _**[ω]**_ [ +] _[ δ]_ _**[ω]**_ [)(1 +] _[ s]_ _[r]_ [)] _[r][ −]_ _[e]_ _[v]_
= _v_ _wheel_ _[v]_ [+] **[ R]** _[w]_ _b_ (1 _,_ :) _[rδ]_ _**[ω]**_ [ +] **[ A]** _[δ]_ _**[ϕ]**_ _[m]_ [ +] **[ R]** _b_ _[w]_ (1 _,_ :) _**[ω]**_ _[rs]_ _[r]_ _[ −]_ _[e]_ _[v]_ _[,]_
(9)
where � _v_ _wheel_ _[v]_ [and] _[ v]_ _wheel_ _[v]_ [are the observed and true wheel]
velocity, respectively; _δ_ _**ω**_ is the error of the angular velocity
measurement, which is _δ_ _**ω**_ = _**b**_ _g_ +diag( _**ω**_ ) _**s**_ _g_ + _**e**_ _ω_, where _**e**_ _ω_

_·_
is the gyroscope noise and diag( ) is the diagonal matrix form
of a vector; _r_ is the wheel radius; _s_ _r_ is the wheel radius scale
error, and _e_ _v_ is the observation noise, modeled as Gaussian
white noise; **A** is the coefficent matrix of the mounting angle
error, with dimensions 1 _×_ 2. Please refer to the Appendix for
the derivation of **A** .

By combining the forward wheel velocity with the nonholonomic constraints, we can formulate the complete 3D
vehicle velocity model as

the GNSS position observation, and the wheel angular velocity

INS, the GNSS antenna’s position in the _earth_ -frame can be
derived as
_**p**_ ˆ _[e]_ _gnss_ [= ˆ] _**[p]**_ _[e]_ _b_ [+] **[ R]** _[e]_ _n_ **[R]** [ˆ] _[n]_ _b_ _**[l]**_ [ˆ] _[gnss]_ _[,]_ (15)


where **R** _[e]_ _n_ [is the rotation matrix from the local navigation]
frame to the _earth_ -frame; _**l**_ _gnss_ is the GNSS leverarm, equaling
to the vector from the Wheel-IMU center to the GNSS antenna

center expressed in the _body_ -frame.
Unlike the traditional GNSS/INS integrated navigation system where the leverarm between the GNSS antenna and the

IMU is fixed, the GNSS leverarm expressed in the _body_ -frame
changes in Wheel-GINS because the Wheel-IMU continuously
rotates with the wheel. Therefore, the GNSS leverarm has to
be computed in real-time in Wheel-GINS.
Given that the origin of the _vehicle_ -frame is aligned with the
wheel center, the position of the GNSS antenna is constant in
the _vehicle_ -frame, which can be measured beforehand. Then,
the GNSS leverarm w.r.t the _body_ -frame can be calculated as


_**l**_ ˆ _gnss_ = ˆ _**l**_ _w_ + ˆ **R** _[b]_ _v_ _**[l]**_ _gnss_ _[v]_ _[.]_ (16)


Consequently, we can get the GNSS observation equation


_δ_ _**z**_ _gnss_ = **R** _[n]_ _e_ � _**p**_ ˆ _egnss_ _[−]_ _**[p]**_ [˜] _[e]_ _gnss_ �



where **R** _[v]_ _n_ [is the rotation matrix from the] _[ n]_ [-frame to the]
_vehicle_ -frame; **R** _[v]_ _b_ [is the rotation matrix from the] _[ body]_ [-frame]
to the _vehicle_ -frame; _**ω**_ is the angular velocity measurement
of the Wheel-IMU; ( _·_ ) _×_ indicates the skewsymmetric matrix
of a vector; _**l**_ _w_ indicates the leverarm vector from the WheelIMU to the wheel center expressed in the _body_ -frame, while
_δ_ _**l**_ _w_ indicates its residual error; _δ_ _**ψ**_ is the attitude error of the
vehicle. Because Wheel-INS cannot estimate the vehicle pitch
angle, it is assumed that the vehicle is moving on a horizontal
plane in Wheel-INS, which means the vehicle attitude only
includes heading angle as the other two components are zero.
Therefore, the vehicle attitude error is only related to the
heading error of the attitude error in the state vector, which
can be written as _δ_ _**ψ**_ = �0 0 _δψ_ [�] _[⊤]_ .
Then, the vehicle velocity measurement model can be
expressed as

_3) Wheel Angular Velocity Observation:_ To effectively estimate the Wheel-IMU mounting angle online, we construct
and integrate a wheel angular velocity observation model into
Wheel-GINS. Note that the wheel angular velocity constraint
is only used for the Wheel-IMU mounting angle estimation,
not to help with the robot state estimation.
Assuming that the vehicle travels in a straight line without
turning and ignoring the Earth’s rotation, the wheel only has
angular velocity along the rotation axis, namely,


� � _⊤_
_**ω**_ _[w]_ = � _ω_ _x_ _[w]_ 0 0� _−_ _**e**_ _ω_ _,_ (20)


where � _**ω**_ _[w]_ indicates the angular velocity of the wheel in the
_wheel_ -frame; � _ω_ _x_ _[w]_ [is the] _[ x]_ [-axis component of][ �] _**[ω]**_ _[w]_ [;] _**[ e]**_ _[ω]_ [indicates]
the measurement noise. As a result, the angular velocity sensed
by the _y_ -axis and _z_ -axis of the Wheel-IMU should equal zero
if there is no attitude misalignment error. Therefore, we can
construct an observation model based on this fact to estimate

the attitude misalignment between the Wheel-IMU and the
wheel. The angular velocity of the wheel in the _wheel_ -frame
computed with the Wheel-IMU gyroscope readings can be
expressed as


ˆ
_**ω**_ _[w]_ = **R** [ˆ] _[w]_ _b_ _**[ω]**_ [ˆ] (21)

= ( **I** _−_ _**ϕ**_ _m_ _×_ ) **R** _[w]_ _b_ [(] _**[ω]**_ [ +] _[ δ]_ _**[ω]**_ [)] _[,]_

**E** = � _−_ **R** _[w]_ _b_ (1 _,_ :) _**[ω]**_ _[r]_ 0 0�



where (: _,_ 2:3) [indicates the second and third columns of a]
matrix. Note that we take only the last two columns of the
matrix corresponding to the actual misalignment error to build
**C** and **D** in **H** _v_ because the Wheel-IMU leverarm error and
mounting angle error are in 2-dimension as can be seen in
Eq. 2 and Eq. 3.
In addition, one may argue that the observed wheel velocity
here is computed with the gyroscope measurement. This means
that the observation is correlated with the system state, which
does not conform to the prerequisite of the EKF. However, in
our previous Wheel-INS paper [6], we have illustrated that
this issue does not significantly affect the performance of
the system. Wheel-INS can still provide accurate and reliable
localization results. Therefore, we also do not take any specific
measures to address this issue in this study.
_2) GNSS Observation:_ We calculate the difference between
the observed GNSS antenna position from the receiver and the
INS-predicted antenna position to build the GNSS observation
model. Given the IMU position propagated by the strapdown

where **R** _[w]_ _b_ [indicates the rotation matrix from the] _[ body]_ [-frame to]

where **H** _ω_ is a 2 _×_ 26 matrix of the form

(23)
Note that we use only the bottom two rows of the matrices
on both sides of Eq. 19 to construct the observation model
because only the _y_ -axis and _z_ -axis component of the wheel
angular velocity in the _wheel_ -frame should equal zero. Therefore, we take only the last two rows of **H** _ω_ .
One may argue that the assumption of the vehicle moving
along a straight line is strong because the vehicle inevitably
turns during motion. The turning of the vehicle will project
angular velocity to the _y_ -axis and _z_ -axis of the wheel, making
Eq. 20 not strictly valid. However, in practice, we can detect
the vehicle turning with the Wheel-IMU. Thus, we can employ
the wheel angular velocity observation model to estimate the
Wheel-IMU mounting angle specifically when the vehicle is
moving straight and subsequently fix it once convergence
is achieved. Our experimental results have shown that the
Wheel-IMU mounting angle converges fast. In addition, the
occasional normal turning of the vehicle has negligible impact
on both the Wheel-IMU mounting angle and vehicle pose
estimation (see Section V-C-2).


V. E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS


This paper presents Wheel-GINS, a GNSS/INS integrated
navigation system with a wheel-mounted IMU. As discussed in
the introduction, Wheel-GINS achieves information fusion in a
similar way to ODO-GINS. Therefore, we used ODO-GINS as



Fig. 4. The number of GNSS satellites used in the three sequences.


the benchmark to illustrate the performance of the proposed
Wheel-GINS. This section presents real-world experimental
results and analysis to support our key claims, namely, (i)
Wheel-GINS has significantly reduced the position error drift
compared to ODO-GINS during GNSS outages; (ii) WheelGINS can effectively estimate the Wheel-IMU installation
parameters, including the Wheel-IMU leverarm and mounting
angle and the wheel radius scale error online, thus improving
the pose estimation accuracy.


_A. Experimental Setup_


To evaluate the performance of Wheel-GINS, we collected
real-world data in three different places with three different
wheeled vehicles. One was the Pioneer 3DX robot [1], the other
was a trolley, and the third was a regular street car. Fig. 5
shows the experimental platforms and the corresponding trajectories. The Wheel-IMU used for the experiments was selfdeveloped. It contains a low-cost ICM20602 [2] inertial sensor
chip, a rechargeable battery, and a Bluetooth module for data
transmission. An IMU of the same model was mounted on

the top of the vehicle to perform ODO-GINS for comparison.
Because we didn’t have an external odometer and it was difficult to access the wheel encoder of the vehicles, we calibrated
the Wheel-IMU and compensated its error in advance to get
the wheel velocity for ODO-GINS, but we didn’t do this for
Wheel-GINS. Therefore, the wheel velocity used in ODOGINS is more accurate than that calculated in Wheel-GINS.

As shown in Fig. 5, all three vehicles were equipped with
a high-end IMU to provide a near ground truth trajectory:
POS320 [3], a tactical-grade IMU for Sequence (Seq.) 1 and
IMAR iNav-FJI [4], a navigation-grade IMU for Seq. 2 and Seq.
3. The main technical parameters of all IMUs are listed in
Table II. We performed a smoothed post-processed kinematic
(PPK)/INS integration method to compute this near ground
truth trajectory. We used the same PPK GNSS position for
both Wheel-GINS and ODO-GINS. The satellite numbers in

the three sequences over time are shown in Fig. 4.

As shown in Fig. 5, Seq. 1 is a one-way polyline trajectory

is a loopback trajectory on a university campus; Seq. 3 is a
large-scale loop trajectory where the vehicle drove twice on the
same road. The average speed and the total traveled distance
of the vehicles in the three sequences are listed in Table III.


We set the initial heading and position of both WheelGINS and ODO-GINS with the reference system. In real applications, the system initialization problem can be solved by
online alignment approaches [45]. We calibrated the attitude
misalignment between the reference IMU and the vehicle,
as well as between the IMU mounted on the vehicle body
and the vehicle in advance using the method proposed in
Chen et al. [46]. Furthermore, we set the initial gyroscope



bias using the static IMU data collected before the vehicle
started moving. Other inertial sensor errors and the WheelIMU installation parameter errors were initialized as zero. The
GNSS update frequency was set to 1 Hz while the velocity
update frequency was set to 2 Hz for both Wheel-GINS and
ODO-GINS.


_B. Comparison of Positioning Accuracy with ODO-GINS_


Table IV presents the position and heading root mean square
error (RMSE) of the proposed Wheel-GINS and ODO-GINS
in the three sequences. It can be observed from Table IV that
Wheel-GINS achieves comparable accuracy to ODO-GINS:
the positioning error is at the centimeter level, and the heading
error is mostly less than 1 _[◦]_ . In Seq. 1, the heading RMSE of

Wheel-GINS is much larger than ODO-GINS. This is because
the unevenness of the road caused significant vibration of the
robot when it was moving. At the same time, the reference
IMU was placed on top of the robot, not on the wheel. As a
consequence, there is a larger error in the Wheel-GINS attitude
estimates.

We can also see that with the integration of GNSS position
observation, Wheel-GINS has improved Wheel-INS from a 2D
dead reckoning system to a full 3D positioning system with
accurate height estimation. In addition, Wheel-GINS does not
show significant advantages compared to ODO-GINS when
GNSS is always available. This is because the high-quality
GNSS position observation has effectively suppressed the error
drift of Wheel-INS and the traditional odometer-aided INS and

helped estimate the IMU sensor errors.
A commonly used method to evaluate the performance of a
GNSS-aided integrated navigation system is to investigate the
error drift when GNSS is blocked [47]–[50]. To this end, we
manually set three different lengths (namely, 30 s, 60 s, and
120 s) of GNSS outages in the three sequences to compare
the performance of Wheel-GINS with ODO-GINS. We set
two outages for each sequence. Fig. 6 shows the horizon
positioning error of Wheel-GINS and ODO-GINS with the
three different lengths of GNSS outage in Seq. 2. Table V
lists the mean RMSE and MAX horizontal position error of
the two systems during GNSS outages in the three sequences.
We can see from Fig. 6 that without the global position
information during the GNSS outages, the horizon positioning
errors of both Wheel-GINS and ODO-GINS are growing.
The horizon position error accumulation increases with the
increase of the GNSS outage period. Due to the random error
characteristics of the IMU, the drift rate is different at different
points of the sequence with the same length of GNSS outage
period. Note that the error drifts at around 350 s in Fig. 6 are
caused by the inferior GNSS conditions where the trolley was
surrounded by high buildings.
In addition, we can see from Table V that Wheel-GINS
exhibits higher accuracy than ODO-GINS during GNSS outages. Compared to ODO-GINS, the horizontal position RMSE
of Wheel-GINS in 30 s, 60 s, and 120 s GNSS outages has
been averagely reduced by 28%, 32%, and 37%, respectively.
The reason for this is that Wheel-INS exhibits a lower error

drift rate than the traditional odometer-aided INS, as illustrated
in [6]. Even though GNSS helps to limit the error drift when
it is available, Wheel-GINS outperforms ODO-GINS during

_C. Online Wheel-IMU Installation Parameters Estimation_


In this section, we delve deeper into Wheel-GINS’s capacity
for online installation parameters estimation to give better
insights into the system characteristics. The results support
our second claim that Wheel-GINS can effectively estimate
Wheel-IMU installation parameters, including the Wheel-IMU
leverarm and mounting angle and the wheel radius scale error
online, thus greatly improving the pose estimation accuracy.

Fig. 8. Online Wheel-IMU leverarm estimation results in Seq. 2. _y_ and _z_
represent the two leverarm components in the _y_ -axis and _z_ -axis of the _body_ frame (see Eq. 2).


First, we compare the positioning accuracy of Wheel-GINS
during GNSS outages with and without the online estimation
of the Wheel-IMU installation parameters to qualitatively
illustrate the necessity of online estimation of the WheelIMU installation parameters. We set two 60 s GNSS outages
in Seq. 2. Fig. 7 shows the horizon position error of WheelGINS with and without the online estimation of the Wheel
IMU installation parameters in Seq. 2.
We can see that the positioning accuracy of Wheel-GINS
is significantly improved with the online estimation of the
Wheel-IMU installation parameters. Specifically, the influence
of the wheel radius scale error is more evident in this

experiment. This is because the wheel radius scale error
directly affects the wheel velocity estimation, which is crucial
when GNSS is unavailable. In addition, we can see that
the Wheel-IMU leverarm and mounting angle errors also
introduce positioning errors if not appropriately compensated.
The Wheel-IMU mounting angle modulates a sine signal onto
the positioning error because of the continuous rotation of
the wheel. The influence of the Wheel-IMU leverarm is not
significant in this experiment because it is less than 5 cm
(see Fig. 8). We can constrain the Wheel-IMU leverarm error
within this level by carefully installing the IMU. In conclusion,
each Wheel-IMU installation error causes position error for
Wheel-GINS at different levels if not calibrated properly.
In the following section, we show experimental results to
analyze the online estimation of each Wheel-IMU installation
parameters in the proposed Wheel-GINS, respectively.
_1) Online Wheel-IMU Leverarm Estimation:_ We first investigate the online estimation of the Wheel-IMU leverarm
in Wheel-GINS. Because it is difficult to get the ground truth
value of the Wheel-IMU leverarm, we can only evaluate the effectiveness of the leverarm online estimation by looking at the



Fig. 9. Online Wheel-IMU mounting angle estimation results in Seq. 3.
The red dashed line represents the reference value calculated by the offline
calibration method [51] (pitch mounting angle: -1 _._ 22 _[◦]_, heading mounting
angle: 1 _._ 60 _[◦]_ ).

convergence of the error. Fig. 8 plots the Wheel-IMU leverarm
estimation result in Seq. 2. The figure shows that the WheelIMU leverarm error can be effectively estimated in WheelGINS, which converges in around 90 s. Because it is difficult
to accurately measure the Wheel-IMU leverarm in practice,
the online estimation of the Wheel-IMU leverarm is essential

for Wheel-GINS to achieve high positioning accuracy.
_2) Online Wheel-IMU Mounting Angle Estimation:_ Experimental results in Wheel-INS [6] and Tan [17] have illustrated
that the Wheel-IMU mounting angle error causes significant
pose error if it is not estimated and compensated properly. In
this section, we analyze the online estimation of the WheelIMU mounting angle in Wheel-GINS. Fig. 9 compares the
online estimation results of the Wheel-IMU mounting angle
in Wheel-GINS with the offline calibration results [51] in
Seq. 3. We can see that the Wheel-IMU mounting angle error
converges to the reference value in around 30 s in WheelGINS. After convergence, it remains stable even when the
vehicle occasionally turns. Fig. 5 (f) shows that there are
some turns and even u-turns in Seq. 3 because the vehicle
traversed the same road back and forth twice. We can see from

Fig. 9 that it does not disrupt the Wheel-IMU mounting angle
estimation. These results back up our claim in Section IV-B3 that the Wheel-IMU mounting angle estimation converges
fast in Wheel-GINS, and the occasional normal turning of the
vehicle has negligible impact on the Wheel-IMU mounting
angle estimation.
One may argue that the GNSS position can also help

estimate the Wheel-IMU heading misalignment as it provides
absolute heading information for the vehicle; thus, it is unnecessary to integrate the proposed wheel angular velocity
constraint model. We conduct a comparison experiment to
show that the proposed angular velocity measurement can
significantly accelerate the convergence of the Wheel-IMU
mounting angle error. Fig. 10 shows the results. As we can see,
with the integration of the proposed wheel angular velocity
constraint, the convergence time of the Wheel-IMU pitch and
heading mounting angle estimation has been reduced from
around 400 s and 900 s to 30 s, respectively.
Although the GNSS position indirectly reflects the vehicle
heading, which helps to estimate the Wheel-IMU mounting
angle, it takes a long time to achieve convergence. In addition,
the accuracy of the GNSS position is also critical. When the
accuracy of GNSS positioning is poor, such as in complex
environments, it even impairs the estimation of the WheelIMU mounting angle. However, the proposed wheel angular
velocity constraint is not affected by the environment. Therefore, the proposed wheel angular velocity measurement plays
a key role in estimating the Wheel-IMU mounting angle to
improve the pose accuracy in Wheel-GINS.
_3) Online Wheel Radius Scale Error Estimation:_ We now
conduct experiments to illustrate that the wheel radius scale
error can be effectively estimated in Wheel-GINS. Fig. 11
plots the online estimation result of the wheel radius scale error
in Seq. 2. From the figure, we can see that the wheel radius
scale error drifts at the beginning because of the coupling
effect from other installation parameters and IMU errors.
Still, it soon converges to a reasonable range. Due to the
pneumatic nature and softness of the tires in the trolley used in
Seq. 2, deformation is prone to occur on uneven road surfaces.
Consequently, there are some variations of the wheel radius
scale estimation along with the sequence. It is also difficult to
accurately calibrate the wheel radius scale error offline because
it varies due to the terrain, tire pressure, vehicle weight, and so
on. Therefore, the online estimation of the wheel radius scale
error is necessary for Wheel-GINS to achieve high positioning
accuracy, especially for the robots with pneumatic tires prone
to deformation.


_D. Discussion_


In this paper, we propose to integrate GNSS with a WheelIMU to build a GNSS/INS integrated navigation system for
long-term seamless state estimation of the wheeled robots.
The proposed Wheel-GINS achieves similar positioning accu


racy compared to the conventional ODO-GINS because they
somewhat fuse the same information: egomotion estimation
from the strapdown INS, vehicle velocity from either the
odometer or Wheel-IMU, and absolute position from the
GNSS. However, Wheel-GINS exhibits significant advantages
over ODO-GINS during GNSS outages thanks to the inherent
rotation modulation effect of the Wheel-IMU.

In addition to constraining the error drift of Wheel-INS,
Wheel-GINS can effectively estimate the Wheel-IMU installation parameters, including the Wheel-IMU leverarm and
mounting angle and the wheel radius scale error online.
Experimental results have also illustrated the necessity and
importance of the online estimation of Wheel-IMU installation
parameters to improve position accuracy. Thanks to the reliable
online estimation of the Wheel-IMU installation parameters,
there is no need for prior calibration in Wheel-GINS, making Wheel-GINS a self-contained solution for wheeled robot
state estimation and improving the system’s applicability in
practical applications.


VI. C ONCLUSION


Our goal in this study was to build a long-term accurate
and robust localization system for wheeled robots. For that,
we proposed Wheel-GINS, a GNSS/INS integrated navigation
system using a wheel-mounted IMU. Based on Wheel-INS [6],
we integrated the GNSS position observation into the EKF
pipeline. To take full advantage of the absolute position information from GNSS, we augmented Wheel-IMU installation
parameters, including the Wheel-IMU leverarm and mounting
angle and the wheel radius scale error, into the state vector
to be estimated online. Furthermore, we proposed a novel
wheel angular velocity observation model to accelerate the
convergence of the Wheel-IMU mounting angle error.
Real-world experimental results have illustrated that the
proposed Wheel-GINS can achieve similar localization performance compared to the conventional ODO-GINS when GNSS
is always available, while it significantly outperforms ODOGINS during GNSS outages. Additionally, the Wheel-IMU
installation parameters, including the Wheel-IMU leverarm
and mounting angle and wheel radius scale error, can be
effectively estimated online, thus improving the localization
accuracy and the practicality of the system.
